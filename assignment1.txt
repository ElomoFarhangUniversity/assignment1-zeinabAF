All work on assignments must be done individually unless stated otherwise. 
You are encouraged to discuss with your classmates about the given assignments, but these discussions should be carried out
 in an abstract way.
 That is, discussions related to a particular solution to a specific problem (either in actual code or in the pseudocode)
 will not be tolerated. In short, turning in someone elseâ€™s work, in whole or in part, as your own will be considerednas a 
violation of academic integrity. Please note that the former condition also holds for the material found on the web as everything
 on the web has been written by someone else.
